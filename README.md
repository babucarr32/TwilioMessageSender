# INSTRUCTIONS

Please, fill your contacts in the contact.json file. Because this is where your application will search for your contacts.
I will recommend changing the current images that come with the code to your own
Dont forget to edit the name of the images in code, 
if you don't want to get your hands dirty simply rename your (if you are using your own images) new images like mine, that should save you from tampering with the code.
